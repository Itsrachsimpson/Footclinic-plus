                    <p>Sometimes more conservative treatments such as foot orthoses (specialised insoles) and corticosteroid injections are not enough to reduce pain and improve mobility and in certain cases people may benefit from seeking an opinion from a foot surgeon. Specialised footwear can be made or fitted to accommodate deformities, but this sometimes confines patients to wearing one or two different pairs of shoes and offers less choice of style than shop bought footwear. It could be the case that the medication you take for your rheumatoid arthritis is preventing further damage to your joints but you are still experiencing pain associated with previous episodes of inflammation and joint damage. In these cases, surgery can sometimes help reduce the pain from damaged joints.
